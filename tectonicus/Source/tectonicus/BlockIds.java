	// Enum thoughts:
	//	using a proper enum instead of constants would be nice for typesafety
	//	and it would avoid autoboxing to/from Integer when used in a Map
	//	But all the data files use raw ints, so we'd have to constantly convert from int->enum
	//	this could add lots of extra overhead in tight loops, especially since we already have
	//	a block id -> block type mapping
